        <h2>1. Project Oversight</h2>
        <p>
            The development and deployment of the University Dashboard are spearheaded by the <strong>Vice Chancellor of Planning and Development</strong>, with technical implementation and maintenance led by the <strong>IMS-Digital Innovations Group (DIG)</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Access and Permissions</h2>
        <p>
            - The dashboard features both <strong>public and private views</strong>. Access to sensitive and restricted data is limited to authorized users only.
        </p>
        <p>
            - Forms and data management capabilities (CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete) are assigned based on permissions per college, department, unit, or office. Access is restricted to users with the appropriate authorization.
        </p>
        <p>
            - The <strong>IMS department</strong> holds the <strong>adminsuperuser</strong> account, responsible for managing and overseeing all user accounts. Offices and departments may request the creation or modification of accounts through the IMS adminsuperusers.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Data Hosting and Security</h2>
        <p>
            - The dashboard's servers and databases are hosted on <strong>UP Manila servers</strong> and are maintained by the IMS department, ensuring the security, stability, and reliability of data.
        </p>
        <p>
            - All user login processes are secured through <strong>Google Single Sign-On (SSO)</strong>. Users also have the option to log in directly using either their username or email.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Data Input, Accuracy, and Accountability</h2>
        <p>
            - Data inputted by users with CRUD access is assumed to be verified and accurate, as the responsibility for data integrity rests with the users who enter and manage it. 
        </p>
        <p>
            - <strong>IMS</strong> is not liable for any incorrect data provided by authorized users. It is the duty of each department, unit, or office to verify and ensure the accuracy of their entries.
        </p>
        <p>
            - For accountability, all user actions—including data additions, modifications, and bulk uploads—are recorded with details such as user identity and timestamps (datetime added/updated).
        </p>

        <h2>5. Data Usage and Analytics</h2>
        <p>
            - The University Dashboard includes embedded analytics features from <strong>Google Looker Studio</strong> for data visualization and reporting. These tools are designed to enhance decision-making and planning across different university entities.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Bulk Uploads</h2>
        <p>
            - The platform offers a <strong>bulk upload</strong> feature for efficiency in managing data. Users authorized to use this feature are accountable for the accuracy of the uploaded data, and their details will be logged with each bulk upload to ensure traceability.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Account Creation and Management</h2>
        <p>
            - Offices, departments, units, and other entities within the university may request new accounts or modifications to existing accounts through the <strong>IMS adminsuperuser</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            - The <strong>IMS department</strong> reserves the right to manage, modify, or revoke user access as needed to maintain the security and integrity of the platform.
        </p>

        <p>
            By using the University Dashboard, all users agree to comply with these policies to maintain the accuracy, security, and accountability of the platform and its data.
